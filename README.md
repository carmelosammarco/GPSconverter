 The idea to developed this **Python based application for manipulating/view GPS data** borned while I was doing some trekking because I wanted a fast way to convert all the file saved and plot them automatically. As many development and during te process I added many other features :) Hope you like it! 

It Can be usefull when:

- You need to visualise your GPS raw data, modified them and export as txt file

- You want have a fast preview of your GPS data on a map

- You need to convert output GPS data to other formats (for example you tack your outdoor activity and for futher processing/scopes you need to have a different file format)

- You want to visualize your data using the native Google Earth engine extention (KML)

- You want to generate an HTML file ready for be embedded in your website or published in a server... 

and many more....
