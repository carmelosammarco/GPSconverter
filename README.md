 The idea to developed this **Python based application for manipulating/view GPS data** borned while I was doing some trekking because I wanted a fast way to convert all the file saved and plot them automatically. As many development and during the process I added many other features :) Hope you like it! 

It can be usefull when:

- You want to visualise your GPS raw data, modified them and export as txt file

- You want have a fast preview of your GPS data on a map

- You need to convert output GPS data to other formats (for example the tracks/waypoints of your outdoor activity) for futher processing/scopes you could have

- You want to visualize your data using the native Google Earth engine extention (KML/KMZ)

- You want to generate an HTML file ready for be embedded in your website or published into a server 

and many more....

```
pip install GPSconverter
```

Then just type on your terminal/command_propt the following:

```

At the moment it is a working in progress. The aim is to be able to realise an executable to run without any python requirements/installation and natively for both Window and MacOS operative systems. However, the Application icon is ready.. here below:
